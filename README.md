# binomial-option-pricing
A personal project implementing the **Binomial Option Pricing Model (BOPM)** in C++.

## Motivation
Suppose we are preparing money to buy shares of ABC stock. However, we are concerned that the stock price might increase before we have the money.  
It would be ideal if we could lock in the current price, or some acceptable price, until the date we are ready to purchase.  
At the same time, we want the flexibility to walk away if the stock price falls below the locked-in price.

This is where an **option** comes in.  
An option is a financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security.

## Types of Options
**Call Option** --- Gives the holder the right to **buy** the underlying asset at a specified exercise (strike) price.  
**Put Option** --- Gives the holder the right to **sell** the underlying asset at a specified exercise (strike) price.  
**American Option** --- Can be exercised **anytime on or before** the maturity date.  
**European Option** --- Can be exercised **only on** the maturity date.

## Profit Diagrams
For a **call option**, we want the exercise price $E$ to be lower than the market price $S$, so we can buy the stock at a discount.  
If the market price is below the exercise price, we simply let the option expire, losing only the price of option (premium).

The payoff is $`\text{max}(0, S - E)`$ and the profit is $`\text{Payoff}-\text{Premium}`$.

The figure below shows a profit diagram for a call option with a $5 premium and a $100 exercise price.

For a **put option**, we want the exercise price to be higher than the market price, so we can sell the stock at a premium.

The payoff is $`\text{max}(0, E - S)`$ and the profit is $`\text{Payoff} - \text{Premium}`$.

The figure below shows a profit diagram for a put option with a $5 premium and a $100 exercise price.

## Asset Valuation
The valuation of any asset is based on the **present value of its future cash flows**. Options are no different.

In the **binomial option pricing model**, the premium is calculated as the expected payoff under given probabilities and discounted at the risk-free rate:

$$
\text{Option Price} = \frac{\mathbb{E}[\text{Payoff}]}{(1+r)^n}
$$

## Assumptions in the Binomial Option Pricing Model
1. There are only two possible price movements for the underlying asset at each step.
2. Prices move either up or down by fixed percentages.
3. The underlying asset does not pay dividends.
4. The risk-free interest rate is constant.
5. No taxes or transaction costs.
6. Investors are risk neutral.

## Example
1. Current stock price is $10.
2. Exercise price is $10.
3. Stock price changes twice in 6 months.
4. Percentage of upward movement is 20% and percentage of downward movement is 10%.
5. Probability of downward movement is 40%.
6. Risk-free interest rate is 8% per annum.

We need to find the premium for a **European call and put option** that matures in 1 year.

Since there are 2 changes in 6 months, there will be **4 changes in 1 year**.

Step 1: First change  
Upward price: $`\$10 \times 1.2 = \$12`$  
Downward price: $`\$10 \times 0.9 = \$9`$  
Probability: 0.6 upward, 0.4 downward

Step 2: Second change  
For $12, the upward price is $14.4 and the downward price is $10.8.  
For $9, the upward price is $10.8 and the downward price $8.1.  
Probabilities:  
$14.4: $`0.6 \times 0.6 = 0.36`$  
$8.1: $`0.4 \times 0.4 = 0.16`$   
$10.8: $`2 \times 0.6 \times 0.4 = 0.48`$

The figure below shows the binomial tree of 4 changes.

For **call option**, we exercise the option when the market price exceeds $10; otherwise, it expires worthless.

Expected payoff:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\text{Payoff}] = (10.736 \times 0.1296) + (5.552 \times 0.3456) + (1.664 \times 0.3456) + (0 \times 0.1536) + (0 \times 0.0256)
= 3.8852352
$$

Discounting at effective interest rate $`0.08 \div 4 = 0.02`$, the premium of the call option is:

$$
\text{Premium} = \frac{3.8852352}{(1+0.02)^4} = \$3.5894
$$

For **put option**, we exercise the option when the market price is below $10; otherwise, it expires worthless.

Expected payoff:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\text{Payoff}] = (0 \times 0.1296) + (0 \times 0.3456) + (0 \times 0.3456) + (1.252 \times 0.1536) + (3.439 \times 0.0256)
= 0.2803456
$$

The premium of the put option is:

$$
\text{Premium} = \frac{0.2803456}{(1+0.02)^4} = \$0.2590
$$

## Implementation in C++
```cpp
// parameters
double initialPrice = 10.0;
double nextStepUpPrice = 12.0;
double nextStepDownPrice = 9.0;
double probUp = 0.60;
double frequencyPerYear = 4.0;
double maturityInYear = 1.0;
double strike = 10.0;
double riskFreeRatePA = 0.08;
```

        20.7360         0.0000         0.1296

         6.5610         3.4390         0.0256

The price of the Put option is 0.2590

## Final words
This implementation assumes **European-style options**, which can only be exercised on the maturity date.

The **binomial option pricing model** is simple, efficient, and widely used for educational purposes. However, it is not fully realistic for real-world pricing since it assumes only two possible outcomes at each step.
